        namely BCA with the front liner section and my other work experience is at one of the well-known cake shops, 
        namely Spikoe ancient recipes in the customer service section. what makes me interested in learning software engineering is that I want to improve myself and challenge myself, 
        and moreover I want to work from anywhere considering my own mother is at home. thank you for being willing to read a little introduction from me.
